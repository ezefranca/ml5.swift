# p5.swift Changelog

All notable changes to p5.swift are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Matter`, a native Swift, Metal-first conceptual port of Matter.js,
  including `Vector`, `Body`, `World`, Matter-style body factories, an
  actor-owned Metal `Engine`, a bundled integration kernel, and a
  deterministic CPU `ReferenceIntegrator`.
- `ML5`, native Swift foundations for on-device machine learning inspired by
  ml5.js, including an actor-isolated `NeuralNetwork`, typed
  classification/regression tasks, `FeatureVector`, and a Core ML backed
  `ModelPredicting` implementation.
- This repository now ships all three packages (`P5`, `Matter`, `ML5`) as
  separate SwiftPM library products from one `Package.swift`.

- GitHub Pages deployment for the DocC documentation.
- Search-engine route pages, sitemap, robots policy, and canonical metadata.
- Agent-readable `llms.txt`, complete context, and structured package metadata.
- A roadmap toward near-complete native p5.js capability parity.
- The `p5.swift` package name and `P5` importable module.
- Automated semantic-version publishing through GitHub Releases.
- Platform, language, test, documentation, and release badges.
- Twenty deterministic Swift Testing tests with a 100% line-coverage gate.
- MIT licensing, contribution guidelines, and a security policy.

### Attribution

- This project is an expanded fork of
  [Juan Hurtado's P5Swift](https://github.com/juandahurt/P5Swift).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Swift 6.2 package support for iOS 17 and macOS 14.
- Native macOS canvas support.
- `ellipse(_:_:)`, `noStroke()`, and `strokeWeight(_:)`.
- DocC API documentation linked to the corresponding p5.js reference.
- GitHub Actions package testing.

### Changed

- `circle()` now accepts a diameter, matching p5.js.
- Drawing state is isolated per sketch and `push()` / `pop()` preserve styles.
- The draw loop uses native display scheduling.
- The preferred initializer is now `init(size:)`.
- Default drawing styles now match p5.js: white fill and black stroke.

### Deprecated

- `init(ofSize:)` in favor of `init(size:)`.
